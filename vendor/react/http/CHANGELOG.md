## 1.0.0 (2020-07-11)

A major new feature release, see [**release announcement**](https://clue.engineering/2020/announcing-reactphp-http).

*   First stable LTS release, now following [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
    We'd like to emphasize that this component is production ready and battle-tested.
    We plan to support all long-term support (LTS) releases for at least 24 months,
    so you have a rock-solid foundation to build on top of.

This update involves some major new features and a number of BC breaks due to
some necessary API cleanup. We've tried hard to avoid BC breaks where possible
and minimize impact otherwise. We expect that most consumers of this package
will be affected by BC breaks, but updating should take no longer than a few
minutes. See below for more details:

*   Feature: Add async HTTP client implementation.
    (#368 by @clue)

    ```php
    $browser = new React\Http\Browser($loop);
    $browser->get($url)->then(function (Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface $response) {
        echo $response->getBody();
    });
    ```

    The code has been imported as-is from [clue/reactphp-buzz v2.9.0](https://github.com/clue/reactphp-buzz),
    with only minor changes to the namespace and we otherwise leave all the existing APIs unchanged.
    Upgrading from [clue/reactphp-buzz v2.9.0](https://github.com/clue/reactphp-buzz)
    to this release should be a matter of updating some namespace references only:

    ```php
    // old
    $browser = new Clue\React\Buzz\Browser($loop);

    // new
    $browser = new React\Http\Browser($loop);
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Add `LoopInterface` as required first constructor argument to `Server` and
    change `Server` to accept variadic middleware handlers instead of `array`.
    (#361 and #362 by @WyriHaximus)

    ```php
    // old
    $server = new React\Http\Server($handler);
    $server = new React\Http\Server([$middleware, $handler]);

    // new
    $server = new React\Http\Server($loop, $handler);
    $server = new React\Http\Server($loop, $middleware, $handler);
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Move `Response` class to `React\Http\Message\Response` and
    expose `ServerRequest` class to `React\Http\Message\ServerRequest`.
    (#370 by @clue)
    
    ```php
    // old
    $response = new React\Http\Response(200, [], 'Hello!');

    // new
    $response = new React\Http\Message\Response(200, [], 'Hello!');
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Add `StreamingRequestMiddleware` to stream incoming requests, mark `StreamingServer` as internal.
    (#367 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old: advanced StreamingServer is now internal only
    $server = new React\Http\StreamingServer($handler);

    // new: use StreamingRequestMiddleware instead of StreamingServer
    $server = new React\Http\Server(
         $loop,
         new React\Http\Middleware\StreamingRequestMiddleware(),
         $handler
    );
    ```

*   Feature / BC break: Improve default concurrency to 1024 requests and cap default request buffer at 64K.
    (#371 by @clue)

    This improves default concurrency to 1024 requests and caps the default request buffer at 64K.
    The previous defaults resulted in just 4 concurrent requests with a request buffer of 8M.
    See [`Server`](README.md#server) for details on how to override these defaults.

*   Feature: Expose ReactPHP in `User-Agent` client-side request header and in `Server` server-side response header.
    (#374 by @clue)

*   Mark all classes as `final` to discourage inheriting from it.
    (#373 by @WyriHaximus)

*   Improve documentation and use fully-qualified class names throughout the documentation and
    add ReactPHP core team as authors to `composer.json` and license file.
    (#366 and #369 by @WyriHaximus and #375 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite and support skipping all online tests with `--exclude-group internet`.
    (#372 by @clue)

## 0.8.7 (2020-07-05)

*   Fix: Fix parsing multipart request body with quoted header parameters (dot net).
    (#363 by @ebimmel)

*   Fix: Fix calculating concurrency when `post_max_size` ini is unlimited.
    (#365 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite to run tests on PHPUnit 9 and clean up test suite.
    (#364 by @SimonFrings)

## 0.8.6 (2020-01-12)

*   Fix: Fix parsing `Cookie` request header with comma in its values.
    (#352 by @fiskie)

*   Fix: Avoid unneeded warning when decoding invalid data on PHP 7.4.
    (#357 by @WyriHaximus)

*   Add .gitattributes to exclude dev files from exports.
    (#353 by @reedy)

## 0.8.5 (2019-10-29)

*   Internal refactorings and optimizations to improve request parsing performance.
    Benchmarks suggest number of requests/s improved by ~30% for common `GET` requests.
    (#345, #346, #349 and #350 by @clue)

*   Add documentation and example for JSON/XML request body and
    improve documentation for concurrency and streaming requests and for error handling.
    (#341 and #342 by @clue)

## 0.8.4 (2019-01-16)

*   Improvement: Internal refactoring to simplify response header logic.
    (#321 by @clue)

*   Improvement: Assign Content-Length response header automatically only when size is known.
    (#329 by @clue)

*   Improvement: Import global functions for better performance.
    (#330 by @WyriHaximus)

## 0.8.3 (2018-04-11)

*   Feature: Do not pause connection stream to detect closed connections immediately.
    (#315 by @clue)

*   Feature: Keep incoming `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` request header.
    (#316 by @clue)

*   Feature: Reject invalid requests that contain both `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` request headers.
    (#318 by @clue)

*   Minor internal refactoring to simplify connection close logic after sending response.
    (#317 by @clue)

## 0.8.2 (2018-04-06)

*   Fix: Do not pass `$next` handler to final request handler.
    (#308 by @clue)

*   Fix: Fix awaiting queued handlers when cancelling a queued handler.
    (#313 by @clue)

*   Fix: Fix Server to skip `SERVER_ADDR` params for Unix domain sockets (UDS).
    (#307 by @clue)

*   Documentation for PSR-15 middleware and minor documentation improvements.
    (#314 by @clue and #297, #298 and #310 by @seregazhuk)

*   Minor code improvements and micro optimizations.
    (#301 by @seregazhuk and #305 by @kalessil)

## 0.8.1 (2018-01-05)

*   Major request handler performance improvement. Benchmarks suggest number of
    requests/s improved by more than 50% for common `GET` requests!
    We now avoid queuing, buffering and wrapping incoming requests in promises
    when we're below limits and instead can directly process common requests.
    (#291, #292, #293, #294 and #296 by @clue)

*   Fix: Fix concurrent invoking next middleware request handlers
    (#293 by @clue)

*   Small code improvements
    (#286 by @seregazhuk)

*   Improve test suite to be less fragile when using `ext-event` and
    fix test suite forward compatibility with upcoming EventLoop releases
    (#288 and #290 by @clue)

## 0.8.0 (2017-12-12)

*   Feature / BC break: Add new `Server` facade that buffers and parses incoming
    HTTP requests. This provides full PSR-7 compatibility, including support for
    form submissions with POST fields and file uploads.
    The old `Server` has been renamed to `StreamingServer` for advanced usage
    and is used internally.
    (#266, #271, #281, #282, #283 and #284 by @WyriHaximus and @clue)

    ```php
    // old: handle incomplete/streaming requests
    $server = new Server($handler);

    // new: handle complete, buffered and parsed requests
    // new: full PSR-7 support, including POST fields and file uploads
    $server = new Server($handler);

    // new: handle incomplete/streaming requests
    $server = new StreamingServer($handler);
    ```

    > While this is technically a small BC break, this should in fact not break
      most consuming code. If you rely on the old request streaming, you can
      explicitly use the advanced `StreamingServer` to restore old behavior.

*   Feature: Add support for middleware request handler arrays
    (#215, #228, #229, #236, #237, #238, #246, #247, #277, #279 and #285 by @WyriHaximus, @clue and @jsor)

    ```php
    // new: middleware request handler arrays
    $server = new Server(array(
        function (ServerRequestInterface $request, callable $next) {
            $request = $request->withHeader('Processed', time());
            return $next($request);
        },
        function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
            return new Response();
        }
    ));
    ```

*   Feature: Add support for limiting how many next request handlers can be
    executed concurrently (`LimitConcurrentRequestsMiddleware`)
    (#272 by @clue and @WyriHaximus)

    ```php
    // new: explicitly limit concurrency
    $server = new Server(array(
        new LimitConcurrentRequestsMiddleware(10),
        $handler
    ));
    ```

*   Feature: Add support for buffering the incoming request body
    (`RequestBodyBufferMiddleware`).
    This feature mimics PHP's default behavior and respects its `post_max_size`
    ini setting by default and allows explicit configuration.
    (#216, #224, #263, #276 and #278 by @WyriHaximus and #235 by @andig)

    ```php
    // new: buffer up to 10 requests with 8 MiB each
    $server = new StreamingServer(array(
        new LimitConcurrentRequestsMiddleware(10),
        new RequestBodyBufferMiddleware('8M'),
        $handler
    ));
    ```

*   Feature: Add support for parsing form submissions with POST fields and file
    uploads (`RequestBodyParserMiddleware`).
    This feature mimics PHP's default behavior and respects its ini settings and
    `MAX_FILE_SIZE` POST fields by default and allows explicit configuration.
    (#220, #226, #252, #261, #264, #265, #267, #268, #274 by @WyriHaximus and @clue)

    ```php
    // new: buffer up to 10 requests with 8 MiB each
    // and limit to 4 uploads with 2 MiB each
    $server = new StreamingServer(array(
        new LimitConcurrentRequestsMiddleware(10),
        new RequestBodyBufferMiddleware('8M'),
        new RequestBodyParserMiddleware('2M', 4)
        $handler
    ));
    ```

*   Feature: Update Socket to work around sending secure HTTPS responses with PHP < 7.1.4
    (#244 by @clue)

*   Feature: Support sending same response header multiple times (e.g. `Set-Cookie`)
    (#248 by @clue)

*   Feature: Raise maximum request header size to 8k to match common implementations
    (#253 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite by adding forward compatibility with PHPUnit 6, test
    against PHP 7.1 and PHP 7.2 and refactor and remove risky and duplicate tests.
    (#243, #269 and #270 by @carusogabriel and #249 by @clue)

*   Minor code refactoring to move internal classes to `React\Http\Io` namespace
    and clean up minor code and documentation issues
    (#251 by @clue, #227 by @kalessil, #240 by @christoph-kluge, #230 by @jsor and #280 by @andig)

## 0.7.4 (2017-08-16)

*   Improvement: Target evenement 3.0 a long side 2.0 and 1.0
    (#212 by @WyriHaximus)

## 0.7.3 (2017-08-14)

*   Feature: Support `Throwable` when setting previous exception from server callback
    (#155 by @jsor)

*   Fix: Fixed URI parsing for origin-form requests that contain scheme separator
    such as `/path?param=http://example.com`.
    (#209 by @aaronbonneau)

*   Improve test suite by locking Travis distro so new defaults will not break the build
    (#211 by @clue)

## 0.7.2 (2017-07-04)

*   Fix: Stricter check for invalid request-line in HTTP requests
    (#206 by @clue)

*   Refactor to use HTTP response reason phrases from response object
    (#205 by @clue)

## 0.7.1 (2017-06-17)

*   Fix: Fix parsing CONNECT request without `Host` header
    (#201 by @clue)

*   Internal preparation for future PSR-7 `UploadedFileInterface`
    (#199 by @WyriHaximus)

## 0.7.0 (2017-05-29)

*   Feature / BC break: Use PSR-7 (http-message) standard and
    `Request-In-Response-Out`-style request handler callback.
    Pass standard PSR-7 `ServerRequestInterface` and expect any standard
    PSR-7 `ResponseInterface` in return for the request handler callback.
    (#146 and #152 and #170 by @legionth)
    
    ```php
    // old
    $app = function (Request $request, Response $response) {
        $response->writeHead(200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
        $response->end("Hello world!\n");
    };

    // new
    $app = function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
        return new Response(
            200,
            array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'),
            "Hello world!\n"
        );
    };
    ```

    A `Content-Length` header will automatically be included if the size can be
    determined from the response body.
    (#164 by @maciejmrozinski)

    The request handler callback will automatically make sure that responses to
    HEAD requests and certain status codes, such as `204` (No Content), never
    contain a response body.
    (#156 by @clue)

    The intermediary `100 Continue` response will automatically be sent if
    demanded by a HTTP/1.1 client.
    (#144 by @legionth)

    The request handler callback can now return a standard `Promise` if
    processing the request needs some time, such as when querying a database.
    Similarly, the request handler may return a streaming response if the
    response body comes from a `ReadableStreamInterface` or its size is
    unknown in advance.

    ```php
    // old
    $app = function (Request $request, Response $response) use ($db) {
        $db->query()->then(function ($result) use ($response) {
            $response->writeHead(200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
            $response->end($result);
        });
    };

    // new
    $app = function (ServerRequestInterface $request) use ($db) {
        return $db->query()->then(function ($result) {
            return new Response(
                200,
                array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'),
                $result
            );
        });
    };
    ```

    Pending promies and response streams will automatically be canceled once the
    client connection closes.
    (#187 and #188 by @clue)

    The `ServerRequestInterface` contains the full effective request URI,
    server-side parameters, query parameters and parsed cookies values as
    defined in PSR-7.
    (#167 by @clue and #174, #175 and #180 by @legionth)

    ```php
    $app = function (ServerRequestInterface $request) {
        return new Response(
            200,
            array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'),
            $request->getUri()->getScheme()
        );
    };
    ```

    Advanced: Support duplex stream response for `Upgrade` requests such as
    `Upgrade: WebSocket` or custom protocols and `CONNECT` requests
    (#189 and #190 by @clue)

    >   Note that the request body will currently not be buffered and parsed by
        default, which depending on your particilar use-case, may limit
        interoperability with the PSR-7 (http-message) ecosystem.
        The provided streaming request body interfaces allow you to perform
        buffering and parsing as needed in the request handler callback.
        See also the README and examples for more details.

*   Feature / BC break: Replace `request` listener with callback function and
    use `listen()` method to support multiple listening sockets
    (#97 by @legionth and #193 by @clue)

    ```php
    // old
    $server = new Server($socket);
    $server->on('request', $app);

    // new
    $server = new Server($app);
    $server->listen($socket);
    ```

*   Feature: Support the more advanced HTTP requests, such as 
    `OPTIONS * HTTP/1.1` (`OPTIONS` method in asterisk-form),
    `GET http://example.com/path HTTP/1.1` (plain proxy requests in absolute-form),
    `CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1` (`CONNECT` proxy requests in authority-form)
    and sanitize `Host` header value across all requests.
    (#157, #158, #161, #165, #169 and #173 by @clue)

*   Feature: Forward compatibility with Socket v1.0, v0.8, v0.7 and v0.6 and
    forward compatibility with Stream v1.0 and v0.7
    (#154, #163, #183, #184 and #191 by @clue)

*   Feature: Simplify examples to ease getting started and
    add benchmarking example
    (#151 and #162 by @clue)

*   Improve test suite by adding tests for case insensitive chunked transfer
    encoding and ignoring HHVM test failures until Travis tests work again.
    (#150 by @legionth and #185 by @clue)

## 0.6.0 (2017-03-09)

*   Feature / BC break: The `Request` and `Response` objects now follow strict
    stream semantics and their respective methods and events.
    (#116, #129, #133, #135, #136, #137, #138, #140, #141 by @legionth
    and #122, #123, #130, #131, #132, #142 by @clue)

    This implies that the `Server` now supports proper detection of the request
    message body stream, such as supporting decoding chunked transfer encoding,
    delimiting requests with an explicit `Content-Length` header
    and those with an empty request message body.

    These streaming semantics are compatible with previous Stream v0.5, future
    compatible with v0.5 and upcoming v0.6 versions and can be used like this:

    ```php
    $http->on('request', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
        $contentLength = 0;
        $request->on('data', function ($data) use (&$contentLength) {
            $contentLength += strlen($data);
        });

        $request->on('end', function () use ($response, &$contentLength){
            $response->writeHead(200, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
            $response->end("The length of the submitted request body is: " . $contentLength);
        });

        // an error occured
        // e.g. on invalid chunked encoded data or an unexpected 'end' event 
        $request->on('error', function (\Exception $exception) use ($response, &$contentLength) {
            $response->writeHead(400, array('Content-Type' => 'text/plain'));
            $response->end("An error occured while reading at length: " . $contentLength);
        });
    });
    ```

    Similarly, the `Request` and `Response` now strictly follow the
    `close()` method and `close` event semantics.
    Closing the `Request` does not interrupt the underlying TCP/IP in
    order to allow still sending back a valid response message.
    Closing the `Response` does terminate the underlying TCP/IP
    connection in order to clean up resources.

    You should make sure to always attach a `request` event listener
    like above. The `Server` will not respond to an incoming HTTP
    request otherwise and keep the TCP/IP connection pending until the
    other side chooses to close the connection.

*   Feature: Support `HTTP/1.1` and `HTTP/1.0` for `Request` and `Response`.
    (#124, #125, #126, #127, #128 by @clue and #139 by @legionth)

    The outgoing `Response` will automatically use the same HTTP version as the
    incoming `Request` message and will only apply `HTTP/1.1` semantics if
    applicable. This includes that the `Response` will automatically attach a
    `Date` and `Connection: close` header if applicable.

    This implies that the `Server` now automatically responds with HTTP error
    messages for invalid requests (status 400) and those exceeding internal
    request header limits (status 431).

## 0.5.0 (2017-02-16)

* Feature / BC break: Change `Request` methods to be in line with PSR-7
  (#117 by @clue)
  * Rename `getQuery()` to `getQueryParams()`
  * Rename `getHttpVersion()` to `getProtocolVersion()`
  * Change `getHeaders()` to always return an array of string values
    for each header

* Feature / BC break: Update Socket component to v0.5 and
  add secure HTTPS server support
  (#90 and #119 by @clue)

  ```php
  // old plaintext HTTP server
  $socket = new React\Socket\Server($loop);
  $socket->listen(8080, '127.0.0.1');
  $http = new React\Http\Server($socket);

  // new plaintext HTTP server
  $socket = new React\Socket\Server('127.0.0.1:8080', $loop);
  $http = new React\Http\Server($socket);

  // new secure HTTPS server
  $socket = new React\Socket\Server('127.0.0.1:8080', $loop);
  $socket = new React\Socket\SecureServer($socket, $loop, array(
      'local_cert' => __DIR__ . '/localhost.pem'
  ));
  $http = new React\Http\Server($socket);
  ```

* BC break: Mark internal APIs as internal or private and
  remove unneeded `ServerInterface`
  (#118 by @clue, #95 by @legionth)

## 0.4.4 (2017-02-13)

* Feature: Add request header accessors (à la PSR-7)
  (#103 by @clue)

  ```php
  // get value of host header
  $host = $request->getHeaderLine('Host');

  // get list of all cookie headers
  $cookies = $request->getHeader('Cookie');
  ```

* Feature: Forward `pause()` and `resume()` from `Request` to underlying connection
  (#110 by @clue)

  ```php
  // support back-pressure when piping request into slower destination
  $request->pipe($dest);

  // manually pause/resume request
  $request->pause();
  $request->resume();
  ```

* Fix: Fix `100-continue` to be handled case-insensitive and ignore it for HTTP/1.0.
  Similarly, outgoing response headers are now handled case-insensitive, e.g
  we no longer apply chunked transfer encoding with mixed-case `Content-Length`.
  (#107 by @clue)
  
  ```php
  // now handled case-insensitive
  $request->expectsContinue();

  // now works just like properly-cased header
  $response->writeHead($status, array('content-length' => 0));
  ```

* Fix: Do not emit empty `data` events and ignore empty writes in order to
  not mess up chunked transfer encoding
  (#108 and #112 by @clue)

* Lock and test minimum required dependency versions and support PHPUnit v5
  (#113, #115 and #114 by @andig)

## 0.4.3 (2017-02-10)

* Fix: Do not take start of body into account when checking maximum header size
  (#88 by @nopolabs)

* Fix: Remove `data` listener if `HeaderParser` emits an error
